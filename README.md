### üí≠ A Personal Note

I believe in being transparent about my journey. As a recent graduate, I'm still learning and growing. Every project here represents genuine effort to understand concepts deeply rather than just following tutorials. I'm not claiming to be an expert yet, but I'm committed to becoming one through continuous learning and practical application.

My approach: Start with curiosity, build with purpose, and iterate based on feedback.
